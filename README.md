# BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR
Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR.

I have used Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a database management system - MySQL. The application has a simple and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information such as Company Name, Card Holder Name, Designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin code. The extracted information is displayed in a clean and organized manner, and users are able to easily add it to the database with the click of a button.

Approach:
1. Design the user interface: Created a simple and intuitive user interface using Streamlit that guides users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information.
2. Implement the image processing and OCR: Used easyOCR to extract the relevant information from the uploaded business card image.
3. Display the extracted information: Once the information has been extracted, displayed it in a clean and organized manner in the Streamlit GUI.
4. Implement database integration: Used a database management system - MySQL to store the extracted information along with the uploaded business card image.
5. Tested and Improved the application.

This project required skills in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and database management. It required careful design and planning of the application architecture to ensure that it is scalable, maintainable, and extensible. Good documentation and code organization would also be important for the project.

Overall, the result of the project would be a useful tool for businesses and individuals who need to manage business card information efficiently.
